    <p>CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.

    <div class="title">Tailwind CSS :</div>
    <p>Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that provides utility classes for rapid UI development. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that offer pre-designed components (e.g., Bootstrap), Tailwind focuses on enabling developers to build custom designs by combining small, single-purpose utility classes directly in the HTML.</p>
